## Topology between 4G & 5G
![跑不出來](./5G_4G.png "")
- Network architecture
  - 4G : uses a BBU (basedband unit) that handles both control and data processing, connected directed to the RU (remote unit) via fronthaul
  - 5G : splits BBU into three units
    - central unit (CU) : Manages control and non-real-time functions
    - distributed unit (DU) : handle real-time processing
    - remote unit (RU) : handles RF function 
  - Effect : 5G is more flexible and scalable
- Latency 
  - 4G : higher latency due to centralized processing in the BBU.
  - 5G : lower latency since the DU is placed closer to users, enabling faster real time processing.
- Transport network
  - Effect : 5G's architecture reduces fronthaul reqirements, lowering deployment costs
- Flexibility and scalability
  - 4G : BBU can only handle a fixed number of RUs
