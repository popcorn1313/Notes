![跑不出來](./Sources/6Gevolution.png "")
- 1G : analog voice services using FDMA
- 2G : digital voice services with TDMA
- 3G : enhanced data rates  with W-CDMA for mobile internet and multimedia
- 備註：
    - FDMA 是每個使用者會得到不同的頻段，會浪費頻寬在 guard bands 上，會隨使用者的提升，降低所收到的頻段大小
    - TDMA 是分享所有的頻段，但是每個使用者在不同的時間使用，比起 FDMA 更有效率，但也增加延遲
    - CDMA 是所有使用者分享頻段和時間，將時間和頻段分為二維變數，分配格子的方式進行分配，比起上述兩種更有效率也更為複雜
- 4G : improved data rates amd efficiency with OFDM and MIMO for IP-based communication
- 5G : use milimeter waves for higher data rates and introduce URLLC and mMTC for IoT applications
- 備註：
    - OFDMA 的核心概念是將頻道細分為多個 subcarrier ，讓不同設備能夠同時傳輸數據，不像傳統的 OFDM 一次只能服務一個設備，技術細節如下：
        - 頻譜分配：（occupies 15 kHz）將頻道劃分為 RU ，每個 RU 包含一定數量的子載波，每個子載波能獨立 modulate ，並根據設備分配不同大小
        - 多設備並行傳輸：不同設備可以在同一時間使用不同的 RU
        - 降低延遲：因可以同時傳輸，提升 peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)，譨顯著降低網路延遲
        - 提升頻寬利用率：更有效利用頻譜資源，減少頻寬浪費
        - 應用：Downlink (DL) transmissions in LTE and 5G
    - SC-FDMA 主要用於 LTE 上行鏈路，它是 OFDMA（正交頻分多址） 的改進版本，旨在降低 峰值/平均功率比（PAPR），提升移動設備的功率效率。技術特點如下：
        - DFT-S-OFDM：SC-FDMA 在 OFDMA 的基礎上增加了 離散傅立葉變換（DFT），使得信號在頻域擴展後再進行 IFFT（逆傅立葉變換），從而形成單載波特性。
        - 降低 PAPR：相比 OFDMA，SC-FDMA 的 PAPR 更低，使得移動設備在發射信號時能夠更有效地利用功率，延長電池壽命。
        - 子載波分配方式：
            - Localized FDMA（LFDMA）：每個用戶分配一段連續的子載波。
            - Distributed FDMA（DFDMA）：每個用戶分配不連續的子載波，其中 IFDMA（交錯 FDMA） 是其特例。
    - PAPR 高的影響：
        - 功率放大器效率：高 PAPR 會迫使功率放大器（PA）進入非線性區域，導致信號畸變和頻譜擴展。
        - 能源消耗：移動設備需要更高的功率來處理高 PAPR 信號，影響電池壽命。
        - 誤碼率（BER）：高 PAPR 可能會增加誤碼率，影響通訊品質。
    - 單載波好處：
        - 降低峰值/平均功率比（PAPR）
            - 減少功率放大器的非線性失真：高 PAPR 會導致功率放大器（PA）進入非線性區域，影響信號品質。單載波技術能降低 PAPR，使功率放大器更高效運作。
            - 提升移動設備的功率效率：較低的 PAPR 讓手機等移動設備能更有效地利用電池電量，延長續航時間。

        - 增強抗多重路徑干擾能力
            - 減少符號間干擾（ISI）：多載波技術（如 OFDM）容易受到多重路徑效應影響，而單載波技術透過均衡技術（如 DFE）能更有效地減少 ISI。
            - 適合高速移動環境：在高速移動場景（如高鐵、飛機），單載波技術能更穩定地維持信號品質。

        - 簡化接收端的均衡處理
            - 降低計算複雜度：相比 OFDM 需要使用頻域均衡，單載波技術可以使用時域均衡（如 DFE），減少計算負擔。
            - 減少硬體成本：簡化的均衡技術能降低設備的處理需求，使接收端設計更簡單。
        - 適用於上行傳輸
            - LTE 上行鏈路使用 SC-FDMA：LTE 的上行鏈路採用 SC-FDMA（單載波頻分多址），因為它能降低 PAPR，提升移動設備的功率效率。
            - 提升頻譜利用率：單載波技術能更有效地利用頻譜資源，適合高效能通訊系統。
